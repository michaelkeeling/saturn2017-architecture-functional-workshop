# SATURN 2017: Architecture and the Functional Frontier Workshop

Functional programming has found it’s way into enterprise software systems.
Pure functional languages such as Common Lisp, Haskell, and ML, which always
had a devoted following in academics, are seeing increased mainstream use in
industry.  Traditional OO languages such as C# and Java have evolved, seeing
changes to the core language and libraries, to allow for programming in a
functional style.  When developers look for their next language, they are
increasingly looking for a functional language.  Rather than working around
Java’s assumption that objects are mutable, they are choosing languages with
immutable data structures built-in.  Rather than imposing self-discipline to
avoid side effects, they are choosing languages that enforce pure functions.

Traditionally, software architects have paid little attention to
functional programming.  The choice of programming language and style
(e.g. OO, functional, procedural) has long thought to be a choice made
within a module, while software architecture is how those modules are
put together.

But functional ideas have crept into software architectures as the
kinds of systems we build has changed.  A few decades ago when
academics began careful study of software architecture, there were few
planet-wide software systems.  Today, even a mundane web application
is a distributed system and may well span several data centers across
the planet.  As a consequence, we’ve changed our architecture pattern
languages and our development, deployment, and operating procedures
(DevOps).

It’s still difficult to build a good distributed system so developers
have used ideas in functional programming to make it easier.
Functional programming (FP) ideas that we see in architectural design
include: statelessness, immutability, and pure functions. These ideas
underlie DevOps practices and are at the core of many distributed
systems patterns.

The goal of this workshop is to explore functional patterns in software
architecture.  Our hope is that we'll end the day with a dozen or so
documented patterns in addition to the some bigger _ah-ha!_ moments, and a
collecton of new questions about the intersection of arhictecutre and
functional thinking.  [Here are some questions and topics we will consider
during the workshop include the items listed on this page](questions.md).

The workshop will take place on Monday, May 1, 2017 in [Denver, CO during the
SATURN 2017 conference on software architecture](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/saturn/2017/).
Workshop participants are required to be registered for SATURN 2017.

# About SATURN

The 13th SEI Architecture Technology User Network (SATURN) Conference — the
longest-running software architecture conference in the world — brings
together influential leaders and experts to discuss architecture-centric
practices for developing, acquiring, and maintaining software-reliant systems.
Architects from more than 20 countries meet annually at SATURN to share ideas,
network, and learn about new and existing technologies. For more information,
