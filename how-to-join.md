# How to Join the Workshop

Interested in exploring the what and why of functional patterns and their
implications on software architecture?  Here is how you can become a
participant in the workshop:

1. Prepare a brief position paper or [pattern seed](pattern-seed-template.md)
   containing your ideas, questions, and experiences and submit it to the
   workshop by forking this workshop repository in GitHub and issuing a
   [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with
   your position paper included.
2. You will be contacted via the pull request by the workshop organizers
   regarding acceptance into the workshop.  To reserve your spot you should
   submit a reasonable first draft as soon as possible, no later than April 3.
   Workshop attandance is first come, first served assuming a reasonable draft
   position paper.
3. Once you are confirmed for the workshop, if you have not already,
   [register for the SATURN 2017 conference](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/saturn/2017/registration.cfm).

Final drafts of position papers are due by April 17, 2016.

## Position Papers

What should be included in your position paper?  A variety of possible ideas
could be appropriate.  [See the list of thinking questions](questions.md) to
help get you started.  The main point of a position paper is to create a
starting off point for planning workshop activities.

Some ideas for what to put in a position paper:

* Explain a **personal experience** - positive and/or negative.
* Describe some **specific problems** that you've encountered when designing or
  building systems that might have been caused by (or perhaps could be solved
  by) functional patterns in the architecture.
* Describe some of your own **philosophy** regarding architecture thinking or
  software design to contribute to the discussion.
* **Ask some questions** -- What are you most curious or concerned or excited
  or confused or ... about architecting within the context of a
  containerized world?  Oftentimes a good question is more valuable than 100
  answers.
* Create a **pattern seed** -- Start a defining a pattern before the workshop as
  a means of organizing your thinking and getting a head start on our patterns
  exercise.

All workshop material will be published to this GitHub repository including
write-ups, images, and position papers.  You can see the
[outcomes from the SATURN 2015](https://github.com/michaelkeeling/SATURN2015-Microservices-Workshop)
and [SATURN 2016 workshops](https://github.com/michaelkeeling/saturn2016-containers-workshop)
for a taste of what this one will look like.
