# Some Questions for Thought

In this workshop, we will investigate the connections between
functional programming and software architecture.  Here are some
questions to stimulate discussion:

* What exactly are the functional ideas that can cross over to architecture?
* How are they used and what qualities do they promote?
* Do they make things more complex or are they a net-win as they reduce
  complexity elsewhere? 
* How do functional concepts manifest in the architecture?
* Are current patterns and tactics sufficient for describing and reasoning
  about functional
* What’s a better name than “functional architecture”?  Of course it
  functions...
* Why are functional designs so desireable?  Why the rise in popularity now?
* Can this paradigm be extended further than it has so far?  What might that
  look like?
* Is this a fad, a trend, or the end-state for distributed systems?  How is it
  situated compared to past changes in architecture?
* What skill sets are needed to prepare developers and architects to take
  advantage of functional paradigm?
